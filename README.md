## **Tagline**  
**Decode the signals, unlock the secrets, and escape the station in this immersive Morse code puzzle adventure!**  

## **About the Game**  
**PARADOX** is a unique puzzle-adventure game where players must decipher Morse code signals to uncover hidden messages, unlock crucial pathways, and escape a mysterious, abandoned station. The game challenges players to think outside the box, combining logic, pattern recognition, and strategic problem-solving in a non-linear environment.  

## **The Problem It Solves**  
Most puzzle games follow a **linear** problem-solving approach, limiting creativity and innovative thinking. **PARADOX** breaks this mold by introducing **non-linear challenges** that encourage players to experiment and find multiple solutions. Additionally, Morse code, an efficient yet often overlooked form of communication, plays a key role in gameplay—introducing players to its real-world applications in an engaging and interactive way.  

## **Key Features**  
- 🧩 **Morse Code Puzzles** – Decode signals to solve intricate challenges.  
- 🔍 **Non-Linear Gameplay** – Find multiple ways to progress through the game.  
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Deep Mystery** – Unravel a hidden narrative as you explore the abandoned station.  
- 🎮 **Immersive Mechanics** – A realistic, interactive experience that rewards critical thinking.  
- 🚀 **Progressive Difficulty** – Challenges scale from beginner-friendly to expert-level complexity.  

## **Challenges We Faced**  
Building **PARADOX** came with its own set of hurdles:  
- ⚙️ **Morse Code Integration** – Translating Morse code into an interactive gameplay mechanic was a complex task.  
- 🐞 **Debugging** – Fixing script errors like incorrect references to objects or missing components.  
- 🧠 **Puzzle Balancing** – Designing puzzles that are engaging and challenging but not frustrating.  
- 📖 **Narrative Integration** – Making Morse code puzzles feel meaningful within the game’s story.  

Despite these challenges, **PARADOX** successfully delivers a fresh take on puzzle-solving, offering a brain-teasing yet enjoyable experience for all players.
